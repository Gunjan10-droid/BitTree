## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or yarn
* MongoDB (running locally or a connection string to a cloud instance)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

    ```
    (Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB URI. For a local MongoDB instance, it might look like `mongodb://localhost:27017/bittree`.)
